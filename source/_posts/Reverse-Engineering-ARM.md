In this chapter of the Android series, I've taken the opportunity to share my documented insights on ARM architecture. Throughout my learning journey, I've explored various aspects of ARM and aimed to understand its nuances, particularly in comparison to Intel architecture. Within this chapter, I provide a comprehensive overview of my findings. I dive into the key concepts and features of ARM, highlighting the similarities and differences it has with Intel architecture. My aim is to provide readers with a deeper understanding of ARM and its unique characteristics. By documenting my exploration and observations, I hope to contribute to the collective knowledge and facilitate a better understanding of ARM architecture within the context of Android development.
