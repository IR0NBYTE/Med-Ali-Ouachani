Time to finally start learning a little abotu web, let's start the journey togthere. 

### I - Motivation
Web yes! The story behind this chapter is the fact that I've never tried to hack into systems before, and the fact of me staying behind my teammates n0s and Firecracker and always watching them do the web while watching, and not understanding what they really do there in CTFs xD since I was always the one playing reverse engineering for the team. I thought maybe it's time to learn a little about it and share some. Huge thanks to Firecracker and N0s for being the inspiration that pushed me to learn it.

### II - The Basics
I need to answer these questions with you now, since they present for me the foundation of everything:

    * How does the web work?
    * What stuff do we need to learn to be effective in web hacking?
    * Do we need a foundation in web development to be effective in hacking them?
    * What kind of attacks can we do on web applications?
    * What kind of tools do we need?

If there are other questions to answer, I will answer them in this chapter or the next chapter.

How does Web work? A good question to start with right? Okay to simply understand all that, the web is based on the model of a client-server where we have a client and a server. 

 * The client is usually a web browser that you are using like the one you are using to read from my blog. 
 * The server is a powerfull computer or network of computers that store and deliver web content and services so basically Servers respond to client requests by sending the requested web pages, files, or data. 

Every resource on the web, such as a web page, image, or document, is identified by a unique address called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). A URL consists of serveral parts, including the protocols, for example, "http" or "https," but wait a second, what does a protocol mean since we are starting from scratch? A protocol is like a bunch of rules to let the client and the server communicate between each other. For example, we can find the "http" protocol that is used for web communication, and we can also find the "ftp" protocol that is used for sharing files between a client and an FTP server. so usually u find the name of the protocol at the beggining of the URL.

What does HTTP stand for? pretty simple
