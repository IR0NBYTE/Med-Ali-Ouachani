### I - Biographie
My name is Mohamed Ali Wachani, I go with the nickname *Ir0nByte* around the community. I've been programming since high school and have gained considerable experience in areas such as algorithms, data structures, Linux, and the list goes on.

However, I dig alone by skipping some classes to play CTFs to research. You can find my resume attached [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1afZT4EQo2WGxx67nyjzGVGmbaylNSbG0/view?usp=sharing).
